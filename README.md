## Azure Storage Account with Blobs and File Share

This repo contains a demo for an Azure Storage Account with Blobs and File Share as the data storage features. The sample pictures show Seattle scenery images. This scenario can be deployed to Azure using the [Azure Developer CLI - AZD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview). 

üí™ This template scenario is part of the larger **[Microsoft Trainer Demo Deploy Catalog](https://aka.ms/trainer-demo-deploy)**.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation
- [Azure Developer CLI - AZD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
    - When installing AZD, the above the following tools will be installed on your machine as well, if not already installed:
        - [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com)
        - [Bicep CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install)
    - You need Owner or Contributor access permissions to an Azure Subscription to  deploy the scenario.

## üöÄ Deploying the scenario in 3 easy steps:

1. From within a new folder on your machine, run `azd init` to initialize the deployment.
```
azd init -t petender/azd-storaccnt
```
2. Next, run `azd up` to trigger an actual deployment.
```
azd up
```
3. If you want to delete the scenario from your Azure subscription, use `azd down`
```
azd down --purge --force
```

‚è© Note: running `azd down` deletes the RG and Resources, but will keep the artifacts on your local machine.
